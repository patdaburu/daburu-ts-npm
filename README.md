# daburu-ts-npm
This is a simple boiler-plate for an NPM module written in TypeScript.
In addition to the basics required to publish the module, it also
contains setup for unit testing with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/),
[Chai](http://chaijs.com/), and [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/).

After [setting up your npm account](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages)
and [.nprmc](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/npmrc) file, run the following
npm scripts:

```bash
npm install
npm publish
```
